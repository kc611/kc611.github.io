          Hi, and yeah welcome to another GSOC selection post. I'm sure most of
          you guys ready this already know about GSOC. For those who don't,
          Google Summer of Code, otherwise known as GSoC, is an initiative taken
          by Google to increase the participation of students in Open Source
          development. So yeah, letâ€™s begin with my journey, and I'm sure you'l
          get something out of it. For others who are just here for the proposal
          well you can just jump down to the last section.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3 class="font1">
          <b> A little fun story:</b>
        </h3>
        <p class="font1">
          <b>May 17 17:00 UTC</b>: It was 10:30 PM in India and I was visibly
          stressed. One hour from now Google was going to announce the selected
          projects for GSOC 2021 and well I had put a lot of effort into my
          proposal and I hadn't really planned what I'd do this summer if I
          wasn't selected, so yeah very stressed. And well time wasn't passing
          as quickly as I was expecting it to, so well I did what I do when I am
          stressfully bored :-P, I started playing Stellaris (it's a computer
          game). Then randomly one of my friends calls me and asks "Bhai kya hua
          GSOC ka?" (Bro, what happened to your GSOC ?). I was like "What?"
          *Sees time. It's 11:32. It was the fastest window switch I've ever
          made from game to mail. And well there it was:
        </p>
        <img
          src="../../blog_img/proposal_screenshot.png"
          alt=""
          class="blog-image-mid"
        />
        <p class="font1">
          I almost jumped "Bhai, hogaya GSOC" (Bro, got selected in GSOC). I put
          down the phone and I stayed there for a minute to let that sink in and
          well, started almost dancing with joy. I still remember my little
          sister giving me -so the nut has finally cracked- look when she saw me
          like that.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3 class="font1">
          <b>The infamous "How I got Selected" section:</b>
        </h3>
        <p class="font1">
          Well, to be honest, my journey wasn't exactly a rigid one with an end
          goal of GSOC in mind. I started out with open source in around late
          August 2020 with the mindset of "Well, at least I could say that to my
          recruiters, that I worked with open source developers". My projects
          weren't that impressive back then, nor were my skills. My first
          contribution was in
          <a href="https://github.com/django/django">Django</a> , it was a
          simple documentation typo. But still took nearly a day to complete but
          well I learned something from that. The fact that there are actually
          checks and tests to each of your pull requests. And you can't just
          randomly change code in a repository. Well, scratch that plan I guess.
          Jokes aside I got familiar with the PR process of Github.
        </p>
        <p class="font1">
          Then around November, someone recommended me doing GSOC. I thought
          might as well give it a go. Python was the only language I was pretty
          confident in so I started contributing to random repositories written
          in Python. (which I absolutely don't recommend if your end goal is
          GSOC. Instead, properly choose an organization to commit to). I mainly
          contributed to SymPy during that period but realized that there was
          much more abstract math than I could handle, and I simply didn't fit
          in there.
        </p>
        <p class="font1">
          Around January, I shifted my focus to other python based repositories
          like <a href="https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3">PyMC3</a> and
          <a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy">SunPy</a>, and fortunately,
          the devs at PyMC liked my contributions to Aesara (formerly known as
          Theano, it serves as a backend library for PyMC),
          <a href="https://github.com/twiecki">@thomas</a> then invited me as a
          team member for the development of Aesara and later on suggested that
          I should definitely give GSOC a try. Around that time a lot was going
          on, Theano being renamed to Aesara, the shift to RandomVaribale class.
          I connected with
          <a href="https://github.com/brandonwillard">@brandon</a> on the slack
          channel of Aesara. He recommended that I continue the work of Aesara
          and PyMC refactoring as a GSOC proposal. So I spent the rest of
          February and March contributing to Aesara and slowly learning about
          things. In around April, I built my proposal, and here we are.

          <b>
            Now for the less boring and straight to the point "Tips" section:</b
          >
        </h3>
        <p class="font1">
          If you are a complete beginner to open source or just starting out,
          here are my few tips:
        </p>
        <p class="font1">
          <b> Beginner's tip #1</b>: If you are someone who's just started out
          with Github I recommend snooping around an organization's docs first.
          This makes you feel familiar with the code when you look at it. I've
          seen first-timers just giving up after seeing how large the codebase
          was and how they couldn't keep track of all the functions and modules
          in it.
        </p>
        <p class="font1">
          <b> Beginner's tip #2</b>: For the first PR, (similar to my own
          experience) I recommend starting with a document typo as, firstly,
          you'll have to search the docs for it. (again point 1). Secondly,
          They're the easiest PR's you could make perhaps even easier than good
          first issues. Remember the main aim of your first PR should be to get
          familiar with the organization's PR process first before you can get
          to navigate the codebase part.
        </p>
        <p class="font1">
          <b> Beginner's tip #3</b>: Now that you know how to make a PR
          properly, you can start with the usual "good first issue" label.
          However, most of them will probably be filled with other newcomers. In
          which case you can click on other small issues, and see if someone has
          already written a basic code for it. I've seen many cases where the
          good first issues are filled with newcomers and there are other
          smaller issues with a solution already found and a complete or
          partially made code is present on the issue page by a core
          dev/contributor. Newcomers completely ignore such issues just cause it
          wasn't labeled as a "good first issue" and they never opened it.
        </p>
        <p class="font1">
          <b> Beginner's tip #4</b>: Always remember to ask if someone else is
          working on that particular issue before you start, in the above cases.
          Or well let's just say your 'community bonding' won't be as easy (:-P)
        </p>
        <p class="font1">
          <b> Beginner's tip #5</b>: For Christ's Sake ask questions and ask
          sensible ones. Don't just give up when you get stuck or make a
          mistake. The core devs aren't going to slap you through the internet
          for messing stuff up (well mostly). Also don't just ask them to "guide
          you" through the issue, show some legwork from your side and ask them
          how to improve.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3 class="font1"><b> Finally the "Proposal" section:</b></h3>

        <p class="font1">
          Here is the link to my proposal =>
          <a
            href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CGxvuv5xwba9jtGbsi6SWqYUMUk1j9xxTa1aa5Uw6EE/edit?usp=sharing"
            >GSOC '21 PyMC3: New Version Refactoring
          </a>
        </p>

        <p class="font1">
          My general advice on writing a proposal, try keeping yourself in the
          shoes of a core dev and write it assuming they are going to get 10
          more such proposals (Cause they probably do). In short, keep it
          concise and easy to read, and the points easy to grasp even to an
          outsider. The number of pages doesn't matter as long as you get your
          idea through. (Some organizations may have min-max limitations on the
          number of pages though). Templates you can use any, preferably pick
          one from previously selected proposals, but the formatting should
          (again) be easy to read and properly highlight keywords. (Again some
          organizations may have pre-defined templates.). And preferably keep
          the about me section in the end and a short abstract at the start.
          Good luck!!
