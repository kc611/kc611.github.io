                  Hi, and yeah welcome to another GSOC selection post. I'm sure most of
                  you guys ready this already know about GSOC. For those who don't,
                  Google Summer of Code, otherwise known as GSoC, is an initiative taken
                  by Google to increase the participation of students in Open Source
                  development. So yeah, letâ€™s begin with my journey, and I'm sure you'l
                  get something out of it. For others who are just here for the proposal
                  well you can just jump down to the last section.

                  <b>May 17 17:00 UTC</b>: It was 10:30 PM in India and I was visibly
                  stressed. One hour from now Google was going to announce the selected
                  projects for GSOC 2021 and well I had put a lot of effort into my
                  proposal and I hadn't really planned what I'd do this summer if I
                  wasn't selected, so yeah very stressed. And well time wasn't passing
                  as quickly as I was expecting it to, so well I did what I do when I am
                  stressfully bored &#128527;, I started playing Stellaris, a PC
                  game. Then randomly one of my friends calls me and asks "Bhai kya hua
                  GSOC ka?" (Bro, what happened to your GSOC ?). I was like "What?"
                  *Sees time. It's 11:32. It was the fastest window switch I've ever
                  made from game to mail. And well there it was:

                  I almost jumped "Bhai, hogaya GSOC" (Bro, got selected in GSOC). I put
                  down the phone and I stayed there for a minute to let that sink in and
                  well, started almost dancing with joy. I still remember my little
                  sister giving me -so the nut has finally cracked- look when she saw me
                  like that.

                <p class="py-4">
                  Well, to be honest, my journey wasn't exactly a rigid one with an end
                  goal of GSOC in mind. I started out with open source in around late
                  August 2020 with the mindset of "Well, at least I could say that to my
                  recruiters, that I worked with open source developers". My projects
                  weren't that impressive back then, nor were my skills. My first
                  contribution was in
                  <a href="https://github.com/django/django" class="bloglink">Django</a> , it was a
                  simple documentation typo. But still took nearly a day to complete but
                  well I learned something from that. The fact that there are actually
                  checks and tests to each of your pull requests. And you can't just
                  randomly change code in a repository. Well, scratch that plan I guess.
                  Jokes aside I got familiar with the PR process of Github.
                </p>
                <p class="py-4">
                  Then around November, someone recommended me doing GSOC. I thought
                  might as well give it a go. Python was the only language I was pretty
                  confident in so I started contributing to random repositories written
                  in Python. (which I absolutely don't recommend if your end goal is
                  GSOC. Instead, properly choose an organization to commit to). I mainly
                  contributed to SymPy during that period but realized that there was
                  much more abstract math than I could handle, and I simply didn't fit
                  in there.
                </p>
                <p class="py-4">
                  Around January, I shifted my focus to other python based repositories
                  like <a href="https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3" class="bloglink" >PyMC3</a> and
                  <a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy" class="bloglink">SunPy</a>, and fortunately,
                  the devs at PyMC liked my contributions to Aesara (formerly known as
                  Theano, it serves as a backend library for PyMC),
                  <a href="https://github.com/twiecki" class="bloglink">@thomas</a> then invited me as a
                  team member for the development of Aesara and later on suggested that
                  I should definitely give GSOC a try. Around that time a lot was going
                  on, Theano being renamed to Aesara, the shift to RandomVaribale class.
                  I connected with
                  <a href="https://github.com/brandonwillard" class="bloglink">@brandon</a> on the slack
                  channel of Aesara. He recommended that I continue the work of Aesara
                  and PyMC refactoring as a GSOC proposal. So I spent the rest of
                  February and March contributing to Aesara and slowly learning about
                  things. In around April, I built my proposal, and here we are.

                <p class="py-4">
                  If you are a complete beginner to open source or just starting out,
                  here are my few tips:
                </p>
                <p class="py-4">
                  <b> Beginner's tip #1</b>: If you are someone who's just started out
                  with Github I recommend snooping around an organization's docs first.
                  This makes you feel familiar with the code when you look at it. I've
                  seen first-timers just giving up after seeing how large the codebase
                  was and how they couldn't keep track of all the functions and modules
                  in it.
                </p>
                <p class="py-4">
                  <b> Beginner's tip #2</b>: For the first PR, (similar to my own
                  experience) I recommend starting with a document typo as, firstly,
                  you'll have to search the docs for it. (again point 1). Secondly,
                  They're the easiest PR's you could make perhaps even easier than good
                  first issues. Remember the main aim of your first PR should be to get
                  familiar with the organization's PR process first before you can get
                  to navigate the codebase part.
                </p>
                <p class="py-4">
                  <b> Beginner's tip #3</b>: Now that you know how to make a PR
                  properly, you can start with the usual "good first issue" label.
                  However, most of them will probably be filled with other newcomers. In
                  which case you can click on other small issues, and see if someone has
                  already written a basic code for it. I've seen many cases where the
                  good first issues are filled with newcomers and there are other
                  smaller issues with a solution already found and a complete or
                  partially made code is present on the issue page by a core
                  dev/contributor. Newcomers completely ignore such issues just cause it
                  wasn't labeled as a "good first issue" and they never opened it.
                </p>
                <p class="py-4">
                  <b> Beginner's tip #4</b>: Always remember to ask if someone else is
                  working on that particular issue before you start, in the above cases.
                  Or well let's just say your 'community bonding' won't be as easy (:-P)
                </p>
                <p class="py-4">
                  <b> Beginner's tip #5</b>: For Christ's Sake ask questions and ask
                  sensible ones. Don't just give up when you get stuck or make a
                  mistake. The core devs aren't going to slap you through the internet
                  for messing stuff up (well mostly). Also don't just ask them to "guide
                  you" through the issue, show some legwork from your side and ask them
                  how to improve.

                <p class="py-4">
                  My general advice on writing a proposal, try keeping yourself in the
                  shoes of a core dev and write it assuming they are going to get 10
                  more such proposals (Cause they probably do). In short, keep it
                  concise and easy to read, and the points easy to grasp even to an
                  outsider. The number of pages doesn't matter as long as you get your
                  idea through. (Some organizations may have min-max limitations on the
                  number of pages though). Templates you can use any, preferably pick
                  one from previously selected proposals, but the formatting should
                  (again) be easy to read and properly highlight keywords. (Again some
                  organizations may have pre-defined templates.). And preferably keep
                  the about me section in the end and a short abstract at the start.
                  Good luck!!
